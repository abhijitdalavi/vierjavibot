# vierjavibot

This project was originally developed in **48 hours**, during our 2018 edition of the Tryolabs Hackathon. 

Please, take into account that the code quality was greatly influenced by the little time available to complete the project.
We are sharing it in hope that it may be useful for those interested in these topics.

If you want to know more about it please check out [this blog post](https://tryolabs.com/blog/hackathon-robot-remote-work-iot-computer-vision/).

This readme is **work-in-progress**, we are working on adding technical details and instructions in order to allow you to create your own remotely controlled robot.
